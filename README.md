## 2. **What is LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)?**


LCEL is a **declarative way** to connect different LangChain components into powerful workflows. It allows you to build everything from simple AI workflows (e.g., "prompt + LLM") to highly complex ones with hundreds of steps—all ready for production with no code changes.


 **Why Use LCEL?**

| **Feature**                 | **What It Does**                                                                 | **Why It’s Useful**                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Streaming Support**        | Streams tokens from the LLM to output parsers in real-time.                     | Get results incrementally, as fast as the LLM can generate them.                                   |
| **Async Support**            | Works both synchronously (for prototypes) and asynchronously (for production).  | Handle many requests efficiently and use the same code for prototyping and deployment.             |
| **Optimized Parallel Steps** | Executes steps in parallel when possible (e.g., fetching from multiple sources).| Reduces latency for faster results.                                                               |
| **Retries and Fallbacks**    | Adds retry mechanisms and alternative steps to handle failures.                 | Makes workflows more reliable at scale.                                                           |
| **Access Intermediate Results** | Lets you view intermediate outputs during execution.                        | Useful for debugging or showing progress to users.                                                |
| **Input/Output Schemas**     | Automatically generates schemas (Pydantic/JSONSchema) for inputs and outputs.   | Ensures data validation and compatibility, especially for APIs.                                    |
| **Seamless LangSmith Logging** | Tracks all steps automatically for debugging and observability.               | Makes complex workflows easier to monitor and debug.                                               |


 **How LCEL Works**

1. **Chain Components Together**: LCEL connects components like LLMs, retrievers, and parsers into workflows.
2. **Run Consistently**: Use the same chains in prototypes and production without changing code.
3. **Customize and Control**: Customize prompts and outputs, avoiding hidden details like in legacy chains.


 **Key Features for Customization**

| **Feature**         | **What It Does**                                                                   | **Example**                                                                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Runnable Protocol** | A standard interface for creating custom workflows.                              | Components like LLMs, retrievers, and parsers follow this protocol.                           |
| **Stream**          | Stream back chunks of the response in real time.                                  | Get partial results before the full response is ready.                                         |
| **Invoke**          | Call the chain with a single input.                                               | Pass one question to the workflow.                                                            |
| **Batch**           | Call the chain with a list of inputs.                                             | Process multiple questions at once.                                                           |
| **Async Methods**   | Supports async methods like `astream`, `ainvoke`, and `abatch`.                   | Use asyncio to handle concurrency for faster performance.                                      |
| **Intermediate Logs** | Logs intermediate steps with methods like `astream_log` and `astream_events`.    | View results of each step as they happen, ideal for debugging complex workflows.              |



 **Input and Output Types by Component**

| **Component**      | **Input Type**                                | **Output Type**                            |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Prompt**         | Dictionary                                   | PromptValue                               |
| **ChatModel**      | Single string, chat messages, or PromptValue | ChatMessage                               |
| **LLM**            | Single string, chat messages, or PromptValue | String                                    |
| **OutputParser**   | The output of an LLM or ChatModel            | Depends on the parser                     |
| **Retriever**      | Single string                                | List of Documents                         |
| **Tool**           | String or dictionary (depends on the tool)   | Depends on the tool                       |



 **Why LCEL is Better than Legacy Chains**
- **Customizable**: Prompts and workflows are no longer hidden.
- **Flexible**: Works across different models and components.
- **Production-Ready**: From prototyping to deployment without changing code.



 **Example Workflow with LCEL**

1. **Input**: User sends a query.
2. **Intermediate Steps**: 
   - Retrieve documents using multiple sources in parallel.
   - Pass the retrieved documents to an LLM for summarization.
   - Parse the LLM's output using a custom parser.
3. **Final Output**: Return a structured answer to the user, streamed in real-time.

# B. Components

## 1. **What Are Chat Models?**

Chat models are **smart conversation tools**. Instead of just reading plain text, they understand **messages** and their roles, like:
- **User Messages**: What you say or ask.
- **AI Messages**: The assistant's replies.
- **System Messages**: Rules or instructions for the assistant.

They’re great for creating chats or apps that need clear, role-based communication.

### **Why Use Chat Models?**
1. **Designed for Conversations**: Understand who’s saying what (AI, User, or System).
2. **Works with Simple Text**: Even plain text can be used—they’ll convert it for you.
3. **Specialized Models**: Some are trained for tasks like tool usage or data lookups.


### **How to Set Up Chat Models**

| **Setting**        | **What It Does**                               | **Example**                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **model**          | Choose the AI (e.g., GPT-4, Claude).          | *"gpt-4"*                                 |
| **temperature**    | Controls creativity.                          | *0.2 = focused, 1.0 = creative.*          |
| **timeout**        | How long to wait for a response.              | *Set to 60 seconds.*                      |
| **max_tokens**     | Limits the length of replies.                 | *200 tokens for short answers.*           |
| **stop**           | Stops output at specific words.               | *Stop at: "Goodbye."*                     |
| **api_key**        | Your access key for the model.                | *Key from OpenAI or Anthropic.*           |



### **Simple Example**
1. **User Says**: *"What’s the weather?"*
2. **System Rule**: *"You are a weather assistant."*
3. **AI Replies**: *"It’s sunny with a high of 25°C."*

## 2. Messages
Here’s an even simpler and clearer version of the table:

| **Message Type**       | **Who Sends It?**   | **What It Does**                                                                 | **When to Use It**                             | **Simple Example**                                |
|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **HumanMessage**        | User               | The user’s input or question.                                                   | When the user sends a message or asks a question. | *"What’s the weather like today?"*               |
| **AIMessage**           | Assistant          | The assistant’s reply or response.                                               | When the assistant answers the user.          | *"It’s sunny and 25°C outside."*                |
| **SystemMessage**       | System             | Instructions or rules for how the assistant should behave.                       | To guide the assistant’s behavior.            | *"You are a friendly assistant who loves jokes."* |
| **ToolMessage**         | Tool               | Results or data returned from an external tool or function.                      | When tools are used to fetch or calculate data. | *"The current stock price for AAPL is $150."*    |
| **FunctionMessage**     | Function (Old)     | Results from functions in older systems (not used anymore, replaced by ToolMessage). | Avoid using; use ToolMessage instead.          | *"The weather is sunny and 25°C."*              |

### Simple Breakdown:
1. **HumanMessage**: User speaks to the assistant.
2. **AIMessage**: Assistant speaks back to the user.
3. **SystemMessage**: Sets rules for the assistant (like "Be polite" or "Speak only in English").
4. **ToolMessage**: Assistant uses a tool (like a calculator or database) and shows the result.
5. **FunctionMessage**: Old method for showing tool results; avoid using this.

This table uses simple terms and focuses on “who, what, when” with basic examples to make it beginner-friendly.

## 3.  **What are LLMs?**

LLMs (Language Models) are AI tools that take **text as input** and give **text as output**. They’re great for tasks like writing, summarizing, or answering questions.



 **Key Features**

| **Feature**             | **What It Does**                                                   | **Why It’s Useful**                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Text Input/Output**   | You give it text, and it gives you text back.                     | Great for simple tasks like generating ideas or summaries. |
| **Works with Messages** | In LangChain, LLMs can handle chat-style messages, too.           | Makes them flexible for different workflows. |
| **Third-Party Models**  | LangChain connects to AI providers like OpenAI.                  | Lets you use powerful, well-known models.    |



 **LLMs vs. Chat Models**

| **LLMs**                          | **Chat Models**                          |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Work with plain text.             | Work with chat-style messages.           |
| Better for simple tasks.          | Better for conversations or workflows.   |
| Often older technology.           | Newer and more advanced technology.      |



 **Why Use LLMs?**
- For simple tasks like:
  - Writing text.
  - Summarizing content.
  - Answering questions.
- When you don’t need advanced conversation handling.



 **How LangChain Improves LLMs**
- **Chat Compatibility**: LLMs can handle messages as if they’re chat models.
- **Third-Party Integration**: Connects to top providers like OpenAI.
- **Unified Tools**: Makes LLMs and Chat Models work in the same way.



 **Important Note**
Most newer AI tools are **Chat Models**, which are better for modern tasks. If you’re unsure, Chat Models might be a better fit.


 **How to Start**
1. Choose a model from providers like OpenAI.
2. Use LangChain to connect and enhance it.
3. Focus on simple, text-based tasks.

### 4. **What are Prompt Templates?**

Prompt Templates are tools that help you create clear instructions for AI models. They take your inputs, organize them, and turn them into something the AI can understand.



### **How Prompt Templates Work**

1. **Input**: You provide variables (like `{"topic": "cats"}`).
2. **Process**: The template fills in the blanks with your variables.
3. **Output**: It produces a prompt ready for the AI to use.



 **Types of Prompt Templates**

| **Type**               | **What It Does**                                     | **Example**                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **String Prompt**      | Formats a single sentence.                          | *"Tell me a joke about {topic}"*             |
| **Chat Prompt**        | Formats multiple messages for a conversation.       | System and user roles with dynamic content.  |
| **MessagesPlaceholder**| Lets you insert a list of messages dynamically.     | Add several messages into a conversation.    |



**Examples**

**a. Simple String Prompt**
For single-line prompts.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a joke about {topic}")
print(template.invoke({"topic": "cats"}))
# Output: "Tell me a joke about cats"
```

 **b. Chat Prompt**
For multi-message conversations.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("user", "Tell me a joke about {topic}")
])

print(template.invoke({"topic": "cats"}))
# Output: [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
#          {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about cats"}]
```



**c. MessagesPlaceholder**
To insert a dynamic list of messages.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    MessagesPlaceholder("msgs")
])

print(template.invoke({"msgs": [HumanMessage(content="Hi!")]}))
# Output: [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
#          {"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}]
```



 **Why Use Prompt Templates?**
- **Simple**: Easily create clear instructions for AI.
- **Flexible**: Handle single-line or multi-message inputs.
- **Reusable**: Use the same template with different inputs.

---



### 5. **What are Output Parsers?**

Output parsers take the **text output** from a language model and transform it into a **structured format** like JSON, CSV, or a Python object. This is helpful when:
- You need **structured data** for downstream tasks.
- You want to **normalize outputs** from language models.



 **Key Features of Output Parsers**

| **Feature**                | **What It Does**                                                                 | **Why It’s Useful**                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Transforms Output**      | Converts raw text from a model into a structured format.                         | Makes it easier to work with model-generated data. |

**How Output Parsers Work**

1. **Input**: Raw text or message from a language model.
2. **Processing**: The parser transforms the output into the desired format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
3. **Output**: A structured result ready for downstream tasks.


**When to Avoid Output Parsers**
- If your model supports **function/tool calling**, use that instead. Function calling is often more reliable and automatic for structured outputs.


**Examples of Use**

**JSON Output**
Convert model output into JSON.

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JSONOutputParser

parser = JSONOutputParser()
output = parser.parse("Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}")
# Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
```

**CSV Output**
Create a list of comma-separated values.

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import CSVOutputParser

parser = CSVOutputParser()
output = parser.parse("Output: name,age\nJohn,30")
# Output: ['name,age', 'John,30']
```


**Key Takeaways**
- Output parsers are ideal for turning unstructured text into usable formats.
- Choose the parser based on your **desired format** (e.g., JSON, CSV, Pandas).
- Use **function/tool calling** if supported by your model for better reliability.

### 7. **What are Documents in LangChain?**

A **Document** in LangChain represents a piece of data, typically text-based, that the system can work with. It organizes this data into a structured object with two key attributes: **content** and **metadata**.


**Key Attributes of a Document**

| **Attribute**        | **What It Is**                                   | **Why It’s Useful**                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **`page_content`**   | The main content of the document as a string.    | Stores the actual text or information to work with. |
| **`metadata`**       | A dictionary of additional information.         | Tracks details like document ID, file name, source, etc. |





**How to Use a Document Example: Creating a Document**

```python
from langchain_core.schema import Document

# Create a Document
doc = Document(
    page_content="LangChain is a framework for building AI applications.",
    metadata={"doc_id": 1, "file_name": "intro.txt"}
)

# Access attributes
print(doc.page_content)
# Output: "LangChain is a framework for building AI applications."

print(doc.metadata)
# Output: {"doc_id": 1, "file_name": "intro.txt"}
```


 **Why Use Documents?**

1. **Organized Data**: Separates content from metadata for better structure.
2. **Flexible Metadata**: Attach any information, like IDs, sources, or timestamps.
3. **Interoperable**: Works seamlessly with LangChain tools like retrievers and memory systems.



 **Key Takeaways**
- A **Document** stores text data and its associated metadata.

### 8. **What are Document Loaders in LangChain?**

Document Loaders are tools that help you **load data** from various sources and convert it into **Document objects**. These are essential for integrating data from external systems like Slack, Notion, Google Drive, and many more into LangChain workflows.


 **How Document Loaders Work**

1. **Connect to a Data Source**: Each loader is designed for a specific type of source (e.g., CSV files, APIs, databases).
2. **Load Data**: Use the `.load()` method to fetch and transform data into **Document objects**.
3. **Use Documents**: Once loaded, these documents can be processed or analyzed in your LangChain application.


**Key Features**

| **Feature**              | **What It Does**                                  | **Why It’s Useful**                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Source-Specific Loaders** | Works with hundreds of data sources like Slack, Notion, and Google Drive. | Makes it easy to bring in data from multiple platforms. |
| **Consistent API**        | All loaders use the `.load()` method.            | Simple and standardized usage.                 |
| **Flexible Parameters**   | Each loader has source-specific configuration options. | Customize it for your data needs.              |


**Example: Loading Data from a CSV File**

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoader

# Initialize the loader with specific parameters (e.g., file path)
loader = CSVLoader(file_path="data.csv")

# Load the data
documents = loader.load()

# Access loaded documents
for doc in documents:
    print(doc.page_content)
    print(doc.metadata)
```



 **Why Use Document Loaders?**

1. **Integrate Data Easily**: Supports a wide variety of data sources.
2. **Streamlined Workflow**: Automatically converts raw data into LangChain-compatible Document objects.

### 9. **What are Text Splitters in LangChain?**

Text Splitters are tools that **break long pieces of text into smaller chunks**. These chunks are easier to process, especially when working with language models that have limited context windows. They also help retain meaning by grouping related pieces of text.



 **Why Use Text Splitters?**

1. **Handle Long Texts**: Breaks large documents into manageable pieces.
2. **Preserve Meaning**: Keeps related information together for coherent processing.
3. **Optimize Context**: Ensures chunks fit within the model’s input size.



**How Text Splitters Work**

1. **Split Into Small Pieces**: Break the text into small, meaningful chunks (e.g., by sentences or paragraphs).
2. **Combine Into Larger Chunks**: Merge small chunks into larger pieces until a size limit is reached (measured by tokens, characters, etc.).
3. **Add Overlap**: Create some overlap between chunks to maintain context between pieces.


 **Customization Options**

| **Customization**       | **What It Means**                                   | **Example**                                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **How Text is Split**   | Choose how to break the text (e.g., by sentence, paragraph, or delimiter). | Split by sentences for narrative text.    |
| **Chunk Size**          | Define the maximum size of each chunk (e.g., by tokens, characters, or sentences). | Use 500 tokens for LLM context limits.    |



 **Example Workflow**

 **a. Split by Sentence**
```python
from langchain.text_splitter import SentenceSplitter

text = "LangChain is a framework for AI. It helps manage workflows. Splitting text is crucial!"
splitter = SentenceSplitter()

chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
print(chunks)
# Output: ["LangChain is a framework for AI.", "It helps manage workflows.", "Splitting text is crucial!"]
```

 **b. Chunk with Overlap**
```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text = "LangChain enables powerful AI workflows. Splitting text helps with context management."
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=50, chunk_overlap=10)

chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
print(chunks)
# Output: ["LangChain enables powerful AI workflows. Splitting text", "text helps with context management."]
```



 **Why Overlap Matters**
- Ensures continuity between chunks.
- Retains context across split pieces of text.


 **When to Use Text Splitters**
- **Long Documents**: To handle articles, books, or reports efficiently.
- **Structured Data**: When working with texts that have logical groupings (e.g., headings, paragraphs).
- **Token Constraints**: To fit within a language model's token limit.



 **Key Takeaways**
- **Text Splitters** break long texts into smaller, meaningful pieces.
- They are customizable for different splitting methods and chunk sizes.
- Adding **overlap** ensures chunks retain context, improving downstream AI performance.

documents = ["LangChain is great for AI workflows.", "Embedding models capture text meaning."]
document_vectors = embedding_model.embed_documents(documents)

print(document_vectors)
# Output: [Vector representation of each document]
```

 **b. Embedding a Query**
```python
# Embed a single query
query = "What is LangChain?"
query_vector = embedding_model.embed_query(query)

print(query_vector)
# Output: [Vector representation of the query]
```
